<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Two models are set-up and analyzed for the adsorption column. Only the loading step is considered. The first model could apply to any situation, but neglects dispersion. The second applies only to the situation where concentration profiles have a tendency to sharpen, but has the benefit of also considering dispersion.</p>
<p>An optimization is done with the second yielding decisions for the column length and cross-sectional area, cycle time and resin particle size.</p>
<p>Several sensitivity analyses are done. Results tentatively suggest that a cooler upstream of the column may be unnecessary, or at least that it is unnecessary for it to be large enough to cool the feed all the way down to 20 °C. A second analysis suggests that the particle diameter is not very important so long as it is within rather wide bounds.</p>

<p>Conservation of mass in a packed bed considering accumulation in solid and liquid phases as well as transport by the liquid moving with velocity \(R\) is given by the equation below. Note that this equation neglects dispersion either due to a velocity profile in the bed or axial mixing.</p>

<p>The dimensionless version of equation 5 is: \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0\), while equation 7 becomes: \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = u - rv + (r-1)uv\).</p>
<p>After a lengthly derivation, which can be found in the reference, the concentrations in the solid and liquid can be recovered from the following equations.

<p>Resin is also assumed to have a finite number of cycles before it must be replaced. This cost does not vary much with the cycle time since the longer cycle times which lead to a longer resin lifetime is offset by the requirement for more resin. Loss of resin capacity due to irreversible adsorption might be a mechanism that follows the above method, if the poisons are present in low quantities and completely removed by the resin. On the other hand, some mechanisms might involve reactants (oxidisers for example) which are not reactive enough that a short bed will completly remove it from the stream. In that situation, it would appear that it would be better to have a smaller bed, since the total rate of resin deactivation will be faster when more resin is present.</p>

<p>Based on the above figure, it appears that the is only a small penalty for running the adsorption at a higher temperature. The difference is only about $1000. This means that the total project cost could be reduced by leaving out the cooler upstream of the adsorption column.</p>
<p>This is because it was assumed that the internal and external mass transfer are goverened by diffusivities which decrease with the ratio \(\mu /T\). There is a significant reduction in the strength of adsorption as temperature increases: the \(K\) which governs the slope of the isotherm at low concentrations drops from above 12 m3/kg to 6 m3 / kg. However, because the product of feed concentration (c0) and \(K\) is still much greater than one, there is only a small impact on the maximum capacity of the sorbent. If it was not assumed that there is a 10x enrichment in FA concentration by the membrane filtration, then the higher temperature will have a much larger impact, since the capacity of the resin given the feed concentration (<em>Qsat</em>) will drop much more at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>Note that this type of result is not backed by experiment, and for example in the paper referenced to find the heat of adsorption <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.12.102">10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.12.102</a> fitted their equilibrium data with lower maximum capacities as temperature increased.</p>
<p>Additional reasons to keep the cooler upstream are:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce oxidation damage to the resin which may be a limiting factor for resin lifetime</li>
<li>reduce polymerization of adsorbed FA, which will reduce recovery depending on the end-use of FA</li>
<li>reduce the need for additional experiments</li>
<li>improve safety, since the column must operates at low pH (2-4) and high pressure, so leaks will be less of a hazard if they are not hot</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="model-2">Model 2</h1>
<p>Assuming that the breakthrough curve's shape no longer varies with the distance traveled through the bed is a common simplification [McCabe Smith Harriott 1993]. Note that some combinations of feed concentration and isotherm do not allow this combination. In short the requirement is that on a graph of the isotherm \(q = f(c)\), when tracing a straight line from the feed composition to the initial bed concentration, \(f(c)\) has to be on the right (section 7.4 H-K Rhee cited below). Therefore this model is unlikely to be suitable for the eultion step, which has not been considered below.</p>

<p>Further support for assuming a constant-pattern behavior can be found in the graphs calculated with it below. It is found that the mass transfer occurs within a zone whose length is much less than the length of the column.</p>
<h2 id="equations-solved">Equations Solved</h2>
<p>Numerical concentrations both in the liquid and solids are only given graphically in general references such as [McCabe Smith Harriott 1993]. To have numerical values of concentrations, the analysis done in section 7.10 H-K Rhee, R Aris, NR Amundson &quot;First Order Partial Differential Equations&quot; volume 1 is followed. The equation that is used in this section to model the column behavior includes dispersion in addition to the mechanisms considered in the above section. Note that some variable names have been changed from the original source to avoid conflicts with the previous section.</p>
<p>\(\frac{1}{\mathbf{Pe}} \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial z^2} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial c}{\partial \tau} + \nu \frac{\partial q}{\partial \tau}\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{\partial q}{\partial \tau} = \mathbf{St} \left( f(c) - q \right)\)</p>
<p>The assumption that the shape of the breakthrough curve becomes constant (in a moving frame of reference), allows the above PDE to be reduced to an ODE. Equation numbers are those in the reference cited above.</p>
<p>(7.10.15)</p>
<p>\(\frac{\partial c}{\partial \xi} = \theta\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \xi} = \left[ \left( 1-\lambda \right)\mathbf{Pe} + \mathbf{St}/\lambda \right] - \nu \mathbf{Pe} \mathbf{St} F\)</p>
<p>(7.10.14)</p>
<p>\(F = (c - c_0)f(c_0)/c_0 - f(c) + f(c_0)\)</p>
<p>exercise 7.10.4</p>
<p>\(n = F - \theta /(\nu\lambda\mathbf{Pe}) + f(c)\)</p>
<p>The above definitions are provided to an ODE solver (lsodar) which integrates backwards from initial conditions \(c \approx 0\) and \(\partial c / \partial \xi =0\). The \(\xi\) coordinate at which the ODE solver starts is arbitrary. The feed is introduced as a step, but the profile spreads out eventually becoming the profile that is calculated with the above equations. The centre of the step has a certain value of \(\xi\), refered to as \(\xi_r\) below, which needs to be known in order to calculate how long the loading step will take. One way to define that centre is that there is no net transport of solute across the centre as the curve spreads out.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/18.svg" alt="areas A and B are equal at \xi_r" /><p class="caption">areas A and B are equal at \(\xi_r\)</p>
</div>
<p>\(A = \int^{0}_{\xi_r} c d\xi\)</p>
<p>\(B = \int_{-\infty}^{\xi_r} (c_0 - c) d\xi\)</p>
<p>Combining and re-arranging gives:</p>
<p>\(\xi_r = \frac{1}{c_0} \int_{-\infty}^{0} (c_0 - c) d\xi\)</p>
<p>For numerical calculations, the infinities are instead \(\xi\) values such that the integrand (before combining the integrals) is close to 0. One additional modification to the above equations is that the average concentration considering both phases (\(\alpha c + (1-\alpha)q\)) is used.</p>
<p>If mass transfer happened instantly, and there was no dispersion, then the profile found would be a step centred around \(\xi_r\), which would travel from the inlet of the bed to the outlet in a time equal to \(t_r = L\alpha / R \lambda\). If the cycle is stopped at a time \(\xi_e\), the step will actually take \(t = t_r (1 + \xi_r - \xi_e)\). Graphically this looks like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/18b.svg" alt="Variables relating to the time at which the cycle ends" /><p class="caption">Variables relating to the time at which the cycle ends</p>
</div>
<p>If the cycle is stopped at a low \(c(\xi_e)\) then not much product is lost, but then the cycle time will be shorter. Below it is found that the optimal design has a \(c(\xi_e)\) at a minimum value, which will be the lowest concentration that can be detected reliably without too much expense.</p>

<p>To make sure that the model has been set up to include competing costs which will keep the decision variables within ranges, first explore two variables graphically. The first variable is <em>cutoff</em>, this is outlet concentration at the end of the cycle. It is assumed that solutes in the liquid inside the vessel is also recovered. The other variable is the interstitial velocity \(R\).</p>

<h3 id="numerical-4-variables">Numerical: 4 Variables</h3>
<p>Below the results are for an optimization that simultaneously considers 4 variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>feed velocity</li>
<li>liquid concentration to cut-off. The optimum is the minimum allowed, which will depend on instrument limitations (not in scope). Below the minimum is assumed to be 50% of the feed concentration.</li>
<li>particle diameter</li>
<li>bed length</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the outlet concentration at which to end the cycle, all other variables at the optimum fall within the bounds set. Important limitations of the current model include:</p>
<ul>
<li>elution part of the model</li>
<li><p>treatment of the hold-up in the column is an oversimplification</p>
<ul>
<li>mixing of elution solvent (EtOH) with water</li>
<li>liquid hold-up is currently considered to be lost product</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>detection limits may be unrealistic for deciding cycle duration. The column design may change slightly if an on-line sensor is unavailble or inaccurate, and instead the column operates with predetermined cycle times.</p></li>
</ul>
