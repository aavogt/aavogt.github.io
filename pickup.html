<h2>Proposed Rules<h2>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p>Put garbage/recycling on the side of the neighbor you like more.</p>

<p>k+1,k+2,k+3.. sequence could be found by dividing the current house numbers by 2GCD, though   </p>
<h4>Sticker</h4>
<p>The drivers put a red/green sticker on the bin, where the text/hyperlink/qr code explains how the convention is exactly the same as navigation buoys (red right return).</p>
